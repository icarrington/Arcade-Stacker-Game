This is a stacker game in the browser similar to one that you would find in an arcade. It uses CSS styling to highlight certain boxes in the grid and translate them from left to right. When the page is clicked or the spacebar is used, the boxes stop at their current position and stack to the next level, while moving faster. The goal is to stack the chain of boxes as tall as possible without the chain hanging over the chain on the lower level.
